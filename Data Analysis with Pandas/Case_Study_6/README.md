Dataset: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks/tree/master/SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data

Part 1 of this project focused on data cleansing. The intial datasets (divided into 12 CSVs) had to be concatenated, and duplicate headers & empty rows 
had to be removed.

Part 2 of the project focused on data visualization. Matplotlib and seaborn were utilized to create several graphs.
